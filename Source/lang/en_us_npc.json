  "npc.deceasedcraft.jackson.dialogue.response.chat.1": "As good as they can go. Central Command’s been quiet for a long time now. It’s anarchy out there. All we can do is help out where we can and keep to the last orders they gave us. I know it’s pointless to be following them now, but it gives my men some semblance of purpose.",

  "npc.deceasedcraft.jackson.dialogue.response.cure.1": "Can’t help you there, sorry. Wasn’t my place to know. I know some groups were tasked to escort shipments of it to the local hospitals, but that’s about it. They never came back.",

  "npc.deceasedcraft.jackson.dialogue.response.trade.1": "Plenty of surplus ammunition. Feel free to browse.",
